---

# 1) Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) — Derivation from Scratch

## Step 1: Scene Representation

We define a function:

```
F(x, d) → (c, σ)
```

* `x ∈ R^3`: 3D position
* `d ∈ R^3`: viewing direction
* `c ∈ R^3`: RGB color
* `σ ∈ R`: volume density

---

## Step 2: Ray Parameterization

A camera ray is defined as:

```
r(t) = o + t d
```

* `o`: camera origin
* `d`: direction
* `t`: depth along ray

---

## Step 3: Volume Rendering Equation

The rendered color of a pixel is:

```
C(r) = ∫_{t_n}^{t_f} T(t) σ(r(t)) c(r(t), d) dt
```

Where `T(t)` is the transmittance.

---

## Step 4: Transmittance

```
T(t) = exp(-∫_{t_n}^{t} σ(r(s)) ds)
```

Interpretation:

* Probability that light reaches point `t` without being absorbed.

---

## Step 5: Discretization

Sample points along the ray:

```
t1, t2, ..., tN
```

Define:

```
α_i = 1 - exp(-σ_i δ_i)
```

```
T_i = ∏_{j < i} (1 - α_j)
```

Final color:

```
C = Σ_i T_i α_i c_i
```

---

## Step 6: Neural Parameterization

We model:

```
F_θ(x, d) = (σ, c)
```

* Implemented using an MLP
* Uses positional encoding

---

## Key Insight

* NeRF models a **continuous volumetric field**
* Rendering is done via **integration along rays**

---

# 2) Gaussian Splatting — Derivation from Scratch

## Step 1: Scene Representation

Represent the scene as a sum of Gaussians:

```
G_i(x) = w_i * N(x | μ_i, Σ_i)
```

Where:

* `μ_i`: mean (center)
* `Σ_i`: covariance matrix
* `w_i`: weight / opacity

---

## Step 2: Gaussian Definition

```
N(x) = (1 / ((2π)^{3/2} |Σ|^{1/2})) * exp(-1/2 (x - μ)^T Σ^{-1} (x - μ))
```

---

## Step 3: Projection to Screen

We project 3D points to 2D:

```
x_screen = Π(x)
```

Covariance transforms as:

```
Σ_2D = J Σ_3D J^T
```

* `J`: Jacobian of projection

---

## Step 4: Rendering via Alpha Compositing

Sort Gaussians front-to-back:

```
C = Σ_i T_i α_i c_i
```

Where:

```
T_i = ∏_{j < i} (1 - α_j)
```

---

## Step 5: Key Insight

* Gaussian splatting = **explicit discrete approximation of radiance fields**
* No ray marching required
* Enables real-time rendering

---

# 3) Plane-Based Derivation (Interview-Style Question)

## Problem

Given a 3D Gaussian, derive its projection onto a 2D image plane.

---

## Step 1: Plane Equation

A plane is defined as:

```
n^T x + d = 0
```

* `n`: normal vector
* `d`: offset

---

## Step 2: Camera Projection

Projection function:

```
x_2D = Π(x)
```

We linearize around the Gaussian mean `μ`:

```
Π(x) ≈ Π(μ) + J (x - μ)
```

* `J`: Jacobian of projection

---

## Step 3: Gaussian Transformation

Original distribution:

```
x ~ N(μ, Σ)
```

Apply linear transform:

```
y = J x
```

Then:

```
y ~ N(Jμ, J Σ J^T)
```

---

## Step 4: Final 2D Gaussian

After projection:

```
μ_2D = Π(μ)
Σ_2D = J Σ J^T
```

So:

```
N(μ_2D, Σ_2D)
```

---

## Step 5: Geometric Interpretation

* 3D ellipsoid → 2D ellipse
* Orientation preserved via covariance
* Scale affected by depth and perspective

---

## Step 6: Why This Matters

This is the **core mathematical step in Gaussian splatting rendering**:

* Converts 3D Gaussians → 2D splats
* Enables rasterization instead of ray marching
* Critical for real-time performance on mobile devices

---

# Final Summary (Interview-Level Insight)

* **NeRF**:

  * Continuous volumetric representation
  * Uses ray integration
  * High quality but slow

* **Gaussian Splatting**:

  * Discrete explicit representation
  * Uses projected Gaussians
  * Real-time capable

* **Shared idea**:

  * Both rely on **alpha compositing**
  * Both approximate the same radiance field physics
